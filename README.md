## <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>

I am a full stack developer looking for a full time role in the industry.

Having recently graduated from Makers Academy, a 16 week full-time software development boot camp, I am now looking to show the skills I have developed before and during the course.

Prior to Makers, I was a Client Servicing Consultant at Aviva. Having spent a lot of my role liaising with, and assisting developers, I thought to myself - why not learn the skills to become one?

Here are some of the projects I've created on my journey to becoming a software developer:

#### Leadership

As a client servicing consultant at Aviva, I was regularly entrusted to organise and lead meetings with the most lucrative clients we had, in order rekindle the relationship with the client, and work with them to improve service levels. Due to this, we were able to maintain a solid relationship with them, and ensure that our reputation as an pension provider remained at the highest level. This contributed to obtaining a further investment of £600m from the client.

#### Learning
Being able to learn fast has been the one of the main reasons why I have excelled in all my roles.  
Makers Academy was a perfect way to put fast learning skills into practice. Within 4 months I was able to learn core principals of software development, and more importantly, the skills to be able to further my learning in the world of software development.

#### Dedication
I joined Aviva with no knowledge of pensions. However, I pride myself on being a stand out performer in all of my career. Therefore, in order to maintain that standard, I took the time to research and learn the skills needed to take on any task given to me. Due to this, within the first 2 weeks of work, I was entrusted to be responsible for our largest and most complex client.

#### Cooking 
Cooking is one of my favourite things to do. From making recipes created by incredible chefs all around the world, to experimenting with different flavours and creating my own recipes.  
Recreating meals that I've had at restaurants is also a hobby of mine. A personal favourite of mine was recreating and, in my opinion, improving the famous Big Mac.

#### Piano  
So I was playing a game called Final Fantasy X, and on comes a tune, played on the piano, by the name of 'To Zanarkand'. Inspired by it, I went and bought myself a piano with the sole purpose of playing that song.  
With sheer determination, and a significant amount of YouTube videos, I was able to do it!  
Next on the to do list: Nuvole Bianche, by Ludovico Einaudi.
